# Scripts for processing of mutations dataset

1. `binom_test_for_mutspec.py` used for comparison of compelentary/reciprocal pairs in MutSpec
2. `featurize_mutations.py` used for adding appendix features to dataset of mutations (ID column and distance to root) and for filtration of mutations
3. `time_splitting.py` used for splitting of mutations on terminal branches according to sample collection time
